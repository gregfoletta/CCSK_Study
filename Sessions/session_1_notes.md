# Session 1

Information security with a cloud nomenclature. Version 4 is the current version. 

Defining and awareness to secure cloud computing. Cloud security alliance operates the CSP certification program.

Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) launched the industry's first cloud security user certification - CCSK.

## Exam Sources

87% of the exam is from *Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud COmputinmg v4*.

7% from *Cloud Controls Matrix v3 v3.0.1*

Once read through, don't get caught up on ISO complexities. It's largely using the NIST definition.


6% from ENISA report: *Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Recommendations for Information Security*

A lot of European terminology in this document.

## CCSK and CCSP

CCSK was the first cloud cert - it's just knowledge. Common sense information security with a heavy cloud terminology flavour.

ISC^2 has teamed up with the CSA to create a robust CCSP.

Resource pooling

## Service Models

* Software-as-a-Service
* Platform-as-a-Service
* Infrastructure-as-a-service

## Deployment Models

* Public
* Private
* Hybrid
* Community

## CSA Security Integration

The lower down the stack the cloud provider stops, the more security the consumer is tactically responsible for implementing and managing.
